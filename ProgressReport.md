Most of the android code in this project has been deprecated as of API 26... 
Because it is mainly a hobby project for my own device that is too outdated to have 26, I'm not updating the code.
That and most of the remainder of the project is to make it look slightly aesthetically appealing.  And add ability to draw own animal.
