The Animal Game

Still in progress - still working on making the game look pretty.

The Animal Game is a single player/multiplayer game where players take turns typing an animal name for a specifi letter.
Users keep naming animals until all users pass, and then round is over.
Rounds can have either a random letter to choose, or players can choose a letter.
High score system that shows the player with the best score.  Score is accumulated over rounds until the player quits the game.
Players are able to add new animals into the system.  Animals can also have a custom picture/fun fact!
